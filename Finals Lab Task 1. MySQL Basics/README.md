- Tell MySQL to Use That Database, This tells the system to focus on multi_level_company for the following tasks.

## Step 2: Make an Employees Table
- This table will store:
- An ID number for each employee (employee_id) that grows automatically.
- The employeeâ€™s name (employee_name).
- The ID of their manager (manager_id), which links back to another employee in this same table (so we know who manages whom).

- Check the Departments Table Structure
- Shows what columns and data types the departments table has.

## Step 4: Create a Employee_Departments Table
- This table connects employees and departments.
- Since an employee can belong to many departments, and each department can have many employees, this table keeps track of all those connections.
